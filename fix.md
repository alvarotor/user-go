🔴 Critical Issues
🔐 Security Vulnerabilities
Authentication Codes Logged in Plaintext
Logging one-time codes (e.g., user.Code) is a severe security risk. Remove from production logs.

Weak Random Generation
math/rand is used to generate login/validation codes. This is predictable and insecure — switch to crypto/rand.

No TLS Encryption
All traffic (gRPC or otherwise) should be encrypted in production to protect against eavesdropping.

No Rate Limiting
Missing protections make the system vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Add rate limiting to auth endpoints.

⚠️ Authentication & Logic Flaws
Login-or-Register Design Flaw
Logging in implicitly creates a new user if one doesn’t exist. This can lead to unauthorized account creation. Split Login and Register flows.

One-Time Code Not Invalidated
Validation codes can be reused until expiration. Invalidate codes after first successful use.

Flawed Refresh Token Logic
The refresh flow depends on the original login code (user.Code), which may expire — defeating the purpose of long-lived refresh tokens.

Re-validation in Refresh
Refresh() re-runs code validation unnecessarily. A refresh token should be self-contained and not rely on prior user input.

🛠️ Performance & Scalability Issues
Inefficient Database Queries
GetByEmail() loads all users and filters in-memory — this is unscalable. Use proper SQL queries.

Race Conditions During User Creation
Multiple concurrent logins can create duplicate users. Add uniqueness checks and locking.

No Connection Pooling
Missing database connection pooling will break under load.

Missing Database Indexes
Fields like Code and CodeRefresh are frequently queried but not indexed.

🧱 Architectural Problems
Mixed Responsibilities in Controllers
Controllers currently contain:

Business logic (e.g., token generation)

HTTP/gRPC-specific abstractions
Move logic to services. Controllers should only:

Parse input

Call service methods

Return response

Leaky Abstractions
Business logic returns HTTP status codes. This couples internal logic to HTTP, even when using gRPC. Abstract error handling better.

Massive Code Duplication
Similar logic appears across multiple files/layers. Refactor into shared services/utilities.

Error Handling is Inconsistent

Sometimes logs, sometimes not.

Mix of returned custom errors, errors.New, and raw messages.
Establish a consistent error-handling and propagation strategy.

Magic Values in Business Logic
Usage of strings like "OUT" to represent logout state is fragile. Use proper flags or enums.

📊 Data & Model Design Issues
Token Model Not Persisted
Access and refresh tokens are not stored. This makes token revocation and session management impossible.

Missing Relationships & Constraints
Database schema lacks foreign keys and relational integrity, making it fragile.

No Database Migration System
Schema changes are not version-controlled. Introduce a proper migration tool (e.g., golang-migrate, goose).

⚙️ Configuration & Environment
Inconsistent Environment Variables
Mixed naming conventions make configuration error-prone and unscalable.

Missing Input Validation
Some endpoints accept unsanitized inputs, exposing the app to injection and other bugs.

✅ Positive Aspects
Passwordless Authentication is a good choice for modern auth workflows.

JWT Implementation is mostly correct and aligned with best practices.

GORM Usage protects against basic SQL injection.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is well-structured and extensible.

📋 Recommended Action Plan
🗓️ Week 1 (Security & Stability)
Stop logging sensitive data in production.

Replace math/rand with crypto/rand.

Add database indexes for Code, Email, and CodeRefresh.

Add rate limiting to critical endpoints.

🗓️ Week 2 (Infrastructure)
Enable TLS encryption in all communications.

Implement proper DB queries (WHERE clauses, not GetAll()).

Introduce DB connection pooling (e.g., using sql.DB correctly).

Fix race conditions in login and refresh flows.

🗓️ Month 1 (Architecture & Maintainability)
Move business logic out of controllers into services.

Implement persistent token storage and management.

Refactor error handling to be consistent and layered.

Add proper schema migration system.

Refactor duplicated logic and improve separation of concerns.
